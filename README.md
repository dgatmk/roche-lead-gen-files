# Roche Lead Generation Apps

Lead generation apps for Roche tradeshow.

## Folder Structure

Each top level folder contains each app. None of the apps share files of folders just to keep everything simple and compartmentalized.

## Databases

The sql databases are placed in the db folder, and are ready to be imported into the local server. Xampp was used to build and test the databases on our end.

## Installing the Apps (iPad)

The apps were styled to look best when saved to the home screen from Safari. This way the user won't see the address bar and the apps will be full screen. Once the production server is up, the apps will need to be saved. We don't know what the ip address will be on our end so this will need to be done either onsite or sometime before the show if we hand the ipads off. Currently it's not clear the timeline for that.

## The Hand Off

Currently, I believe the plan is to export the populated database as a csv and hand it off directly to Roche to upload to their lead generation platform. We will need to double check with Roche and see if that plan workd for them and if csv is a good format for their platform(usually is).
